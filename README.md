# Random Meal Picker – Random meal picker for groups

A simple dApp that helps a group randomly pick a meal.  
The frontend is built with **Next.js + React + TypeScript**, and the smart contract is written in **IOTA Move** and deployed on an IOTA network (devnet/testnet).

---

## Features

- Connect to an **IOTA wallet** using `@iota/dapp-kit`.
- Let the user enter a numeric **seed** and call the Move function `pick_random`.
- The contract computes a pseudo-random index and creates a **`MealChoice`** object on-chain.
- The frontend:
  - Maps the index to a fixed list of meals (Sushi, Pizza, Burger, Phở, Salad, Curry).
  - Shows the chosen meal, the on-chain object ID, and the **transaction hash**.
- Remembers the last `MealChoice` for each wallet address using `localStorage`.

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Next.js** (App Router, React, TypeScript)
- **@iota/dapp-kit** – wallet connection and RPC client
- **@iota/iota-sdk** – client & transaction builder
- **@radix-ui/themes** – UI components

### Smart Contract

- **Language:** IOTA Move
- **Module name:** `meal_picker`
- **Main entry function:** `pick_random(meal_count: u64, seed: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext)`
- **On-chain object:** `MealChoice` (stores chosen index, seed, and user address)

1. Requirements

Make sure you have:

Node.js >= 20.9.0

npm (comes with Node.js)

IOTA CLI (iota binary) installed and configured

An IOTA wallet (e.g. browser extension) that can connect via dApp Kit

Access to devnet or testnet (depending on how you deploy)

2. Installation & Local Development
2.1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/21011612/Random-Meal-Picker.git
cd Random-Meal-Picker

2.2. Install dependencies
npm install
# or, if needed:
# npm install --legacy-peer-deps

2.3. Start the Next.js dev server
npm run dev


The app will start on:

http://localhost:3000


Open this URL in your browser and connect your IOTA wallet.

3. Smart Contract (Move) – meal_picker

The Move contract is located at:

contract/random_meal_picker/sources/meal_picker.move

3.1. Module & Types

Module: random_meal_picker::meal_picker

Main struct:

public struct MealChoice has key, store {
    id: UID,
    index: u64,
    seed: u64,
    user: address,
}


Entry function:

public fun pick_random(
    meal_count: u64,
    seed: u64,
    ctx: &mut tx_context::TxContext
) { /* ... */ }


The contract:

Uses meal_count (number of meals on frontend) and a numeric seed.

Computes a pseudo-random number based on seed.

Calculates index = random_value % meal_count.

Creates a MealChoice object with { index, seed, user } and transfers it to the sender.

4. Deploying the Move Contract

This project comes with a helper script that builds and publishes the Move package to an IOTA network (devnet/testnet).

From the project root:

npm run iota-deploy


You will be prompted for:

Network – choose devnet or testnet.

Address – continue with an existing address or create a new one.

The script:

Builds the Move package under contract/random_meal_picker.

Publishes it to the chosen IOTA network.

Prints the Package ID.

Updates lib/config.ts with the new package ID for the selected network.

Updates INSTRUCTION_GUIDE.md and (if possible) integration hints.

After deployment, note:

The Package ID (shown at the end of the script).

The network where it was deployed (devnet/testnet).

5. Frontend Integration (React / Next.js)
5.1. Providers

In app/layout.tsx and components/Provider.tsx, the app is wrapped with:

IotaClientProvider

WalletProvider

Theme from @radix-ui/themes

These providers:

Configure the IOTA JSON-RPC endpoint.

Manage wallet connection state.

Provide styling and consistent UI theme.

5.2. Contract Hook – hooks/useContract.ts

useContract.ts centralizes all contract logic:

Configuration:

export const CONTRACT_PACKAGE_ID = "<your-package-id>"; // updated by iota-deploy
export const CONTRACT_MODULE = "meal_picker";
export const CONTRACT_METHODS = {
  PICK_RANDOM: "pick_random",
} as const;


Data shape from chain:

export interface ContractData {
  index: number;
  seed: number;
  user: string;
}


Key responsibilities:

Build a transaction with Transaction from @iota/iota-sdk/transactions.

Call:

tx.moveCall({
  arguments: [tx.pure.u64(mealCount), tx.pure.u64(seed)],
  target: `${packageId}::${CONTRACT_MODULE}::${CONTRACT_METHODS.PICK_RANDOM}`,
});


Use useSignAndExecuteTransaction to sign and submit.

Wait for confirmation via iotaClient.waitForTransaction.

Extract the created MealChoice object ID from transaction effects.

Store mealChoiceId_<address> in localStorage.

Fetch the object later using useIotaClientQuery("getObject", ...).

Returned values:

{
  data,          // parsed MealChoice fields (index, seed, user) | null
  actions: {
    pickRandomMeal(mealCount, seed),
    clearChoice(),
  },
  state: {
    isLoading,
    isPending,
    isConfirming,
    isConfirmed,
    hash,
    error,
  },
  choiceId,      // on-chain object ID of the last MealChoice
  objectExists,
  hasValidData,
  isFetching,
}

5.3. UI Component – components/sample.tsx

This is the main Random Meal Picker UI:

Checks wallet connection with useCurrentAccount().

If not connected:

Shows a message asking the user to connect their wallet.

If connected:

Shows:

The fixed meal list (index + emoji name).

A numeric input for seed.

A “🎲 Pick Meal” button that calls actions.pickRandomMeal(MEALS.length, seed).

If a MealChoice exists:

Displays the chosen meal, index, seed, and MealChoice ID.

Also displays:

Current transaction hash.

Confirmation status.

Any error messages from contract calls.

6. How to Run the dApp Locally

Install dependencies

npm install


(Optional) Deploy contract

If you haven’t deployed your own version yet:

npm run iota-deploy


Choose a network (devnet or testnet).

Wait for the script to finish.

Confirm that lib/config.ts now contains the correct PACKAGE_ID for that network.

Start the dev server

npm run dev


Open the app

Go to http://localhost:3000.

Connect your IOTA wallet when prompted (via dApp Kit / wallet extension).

Enter any seed number you like and press “🎲 Pick Meal”.

The frontend will show:

The chosen meal (based on the on-chain index).

The on-chain MealChoice ID.

The transaction hash.
